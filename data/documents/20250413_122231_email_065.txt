Dear Steve,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of Project Alpha. Since joining Onyx Corporation in 2015, Sandra Johnson has consistently delivered excellent results and she continues to do so with this project, which is on track for completion by the end of this quarter.

Best regards,

James Callahan
Project Manager, Onyx Corporation
