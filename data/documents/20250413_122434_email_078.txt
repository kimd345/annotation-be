Subject: Department Transfer Request

Dear Sarah Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request a transfer from the Marketing Department to the Sales Department at Patterson Corp. Since joining the company in 2015, I have always admired how effective and dynamic the Sales team under your leadership has been.

Thank you for considering my request. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to the Sales Department's continued success.

Best regards,

John Davenport
Marketing Specialist, Patterson Corp.
