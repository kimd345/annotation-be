Dear Sarah Thompson,

I wanted to personally update you that the project, which James Peterson started when he joined our company, XYZ Corp, in April, is making great progress. It's impressive to see how James's leadership has expedited the process, reflecting positively on ABC Enterprises.

Best Regards,
John Richardson
Senior Project Manager, XYZ Corp
