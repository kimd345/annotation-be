Subject: Request for Project Collaboration

Dear Jane Doe,

I am impressed by the innovative work you've been leading at XYZ Corporation since you joined in 2017. I believe a collaboration between our companies, ABC Enterprises and XYZ Corporation, could result in significant mutual benefits. Let's discuss this possibility further at your earliest convenience.

Best Regards,
John Smith,
Senior Project Manager, ABC Enterprises
